# Animal_Sound_Dataset_Edge_Impulse

This colab script downloads the environmental-sound-classification-50 and extract animal sounds.
It manipulates the WAV files and upload to Edge Impulse to build a model to recognize animal sounds using Arduino.

You can find all the details to use this dataset in this tutorial Link: [Arduino RP2040 Sound classification using Machine Learning: Animal Sounds](https://www.survivingwithandroid.com/arduino-rp2040-sound-classification-machine-learning/)
